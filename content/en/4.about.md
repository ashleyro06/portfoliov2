I’m a passionate developer who thrives on continuous learning and solving complex problems through thoughtful engineering. My work blends creativity and functionality to deliver reliable, high-performance solutions that users enjoy and businesses trust.
<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I’m a **Full-Stack Developer at GoodRec**, where I help build and improve user-facing features and internal systems. I’ve contributed to chat functionality, developed core modules, and supported the tech team in transitioning to new technologies.
<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I’ve developed software for a wide range of organizations — from local governments, where I built mobile-friendly platforms for public service, to companies, where I helped launch new products and backend systems.
<br/>
<br/>
No matter the stack, I focus on delivering accessible, maintainable, and efficient solutions.
